# Mathematical-Optimization-Project
This repository contains all the code for the Mathematical Optimization exam at @units

This folder contains the following files:
- GUROBI_implementation.ipynb: this file contains the implementation of the models with GUROBI. The models are implemented in two python classes, contained in the files RTOP_LA.py and RTOP_LA_paper, which are imported in the notebook.
- notebook_paper_implementation.ipynb: this file contains the implementation of the paper's model (with GUROBI) with all the functions contained in the notebook.
- Heuristic.ipynb: implementation of the complete heuristic algorithm. 
The notebook import as modules all the others python files.
